# TwitchChat
Twitch Chat integration with minigames etc. - I would be happy if you mind me when you are using parts or the whole thing.

I found a few "Bots" for twitch, but they're either expensive or look very awful. So I decided to make my own little program.

It's not quite ready yet, but the chat feature works. If you want to edit or compile my program, you have to download http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php (to develop I used the version 1.5.0), after that you've to reference this external jar file in the project where it's needed.
For JSON Respones from the Twitch.tv-API I used http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json in version 20160212.
Before the first start: put the pircbot.jar into /TwitchChat/pircbot.jar and put the json-20160212.jar into /TwitchShared/json-20160212.jar (this is important, otherwise you have to fix the references manually)!

If you've questions send me a private message. If you want to contribute - write me. If you've ideas for what would be useful, add it under issues or write me a message.

I hope this is all for now.

And by the way - 
I don't like the word bot :)
